From pitch to portfolio: scaffold for your capstone website project!

This is your **starter repo** — you’ll use it for every lesson, building toward your final capstone website.

# Personal Website Capstone Template

Welcome! This repo is your starting point for Tech Curriculum.  
Over 6 lessons, you will build a **portfolio/personal website** you can share on LinkedIn or wherever you like!  

# Structure
- `/src` → Your website’s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- `/docs` → Documentation (pitch, ML design, API notes)
- `/planning` → Agile/Scrum backlog + sprint plans

# Lessons
1. GitHub Setup + Capstone Pitch (`/docs/pitch.md`)
2. Agile & Scrum (backlog + sprint plan in `/planning`)
3. HTML & CSS Foundation (`index.html`, `styles.css`)
4. JavaScript Interactivity (`/src/js/main.js`)
5. Intro to Machine Learning (`/docs/ml-design.md`, add `ml.html`)
6. API Integration (`/docs/api-notes.md`, add `live.html`)

# Final Capstone
By the end, you’ll have a functional personal website with:
- Responsive design
- At least one interactive feature
- One embedded ML-powered feature
- One real-time API integration
